# Implementation Plan: Sellers Panel UX

**Branch**: `013-sellers-panel-ux` | **Date**: 2026-02-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-sellers-panel-ux/spec.md`

## Summary

Improve the sellers panel UX with two changes: (1) debounced realtime search filtering using HTMX's native `hx-trigger="input changed delay:300ms"` — no custom JS needed; (2) skeleton loading placeholders in the events panel when a seller is clicked, replacing the current semi-transparent overlay with structured placeholder bars + spinner. Also sort events by start_date descending.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.14, Django 5
**Primary Dependencies**: HTMX 2.0.4 (CDN), ABConnectTools 0.2.1 (editable install)
**Storage**: SQLite3 (sessions + Django User table) — no changes
**Testing**: pytest + pytest-django
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop primary, mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: Web application (Django server-rendered with HTMX)
**Performance Goals**: Filter response < 500ms including 300ms debounce; skeleton visible within 50ms of click
**Constraints**: No new JS libraries; use HTMX native features and vanilla JS
**Scale/Scope**: 4 source files changed (template, shell, CSS, view), 1 test file updated

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Research Gate

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Artifact Harmony | PASS | Spec, plan, contracts, tests, template, CSS, view updated together |
| II. Executable Knowledge | PASS | Contract tests validate trigger attributes, skeleton injection, sort order |
| III. Contracted Boundaries | PASS | Rendering contract in `contracts/sellers-panel.md` |
| IV. Versioned Traceability | PASS | Single feature branch |
| V. Communicable Truth | PASS | Quickstart covers manual + automated testing |

### Post-Design Gate

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Artifact Harmony | PASS | All artifacts aligned |
| II. Executable Knowledge | PASS | Tests cover debounce trigger, event sort, existing behavior |
| III. Contracted Boundaries | PASS | HTMX attribute contract and skeleton structure defined |
| IV. Versioned Traceability | PASS | Single branch, clear history |
| V. Communicable Truth | PASS | Quickstart has step-by-step manual test plan |
